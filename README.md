# OpenGLPirateShipDemo
Real-Time 3D OpenGL Application of a low-poly pirate ship in water.

This project is a real-time 3D graphics application I built in C++ and OpenGL, featuring:

Imported 3D Models – Rendered using custom made GLSL shaders<br>
Texture Mapping – Applied to two 3D models<br>
Advanced Lighting – Two light sources (Directional & Fill Light)

The repository includes both the Visual Studio project source code and the standalone executable build.

Technologies Used: OpenGL, GLSL, Assimp, GLFW, ImGui, stb_image.<br>

The player can use WASD keys to move the camera and holding right click while moving the mouse will pan the camera.
